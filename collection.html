            <p>The museum holds the extensive collection, accumulated over the years by the founder Zera Knowles. 
                The collection includes works by several internationally recognized artists such as Jean-Michel Basquiat, Liu Wei, 
                Takashi Murakami, Sean Scully, Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst. </p>
            <p>However, the main goal of the museum has always been to enable young, less known artists to present their works and accompanying ideas. 
                Therefore, the key focus of the museum's activity is to organize temporary exhibitions that perfectly complement the main collection 
                and allow you to constantly gain fresh experience.  We are also proud to say, that many our temporary exhibitions includes works 
                that have never been exhibited before.</p>
            <p>The collection does not concentrate on any specific era and does not single out any styles or groups, but reflects an in-depth attention 
                to the work of a wide variety of artists from all around the world. The presentation on show often includes several works by individual artists, 
                in order to highlight the breadth and depth of their compositions.</p>
